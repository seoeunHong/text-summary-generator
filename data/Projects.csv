It will do so by leveraging almost $ 16.7 million in multilateral and private sector financing over its five-year implementation period. Over the same period, 4 small hydropower stations will be developed to supply electricity services to an equal number of villages through mini-grids for income-generating activities and household/community use. Energisation of the villages will result in generation of some 39,770 MWh of electricity over the project timeframe and an annual generation of 14,535 MWh will be sustained over an expected 25-year projected life of the installations. This, in turn, will result in avoiding 35,000 tonnes of CO2 during the 5-year project period and 13,000 tonnes of CO2 thereafter annually over the remaining almost 21-23 years of the equipment useful life. Finally, over the 25-year projected lifetime of the equipment, 327,250 tonnes of CO2 will be avoided.",,,Missing

It has been organized into five outcomes:
1)	Enabling framework for a green sustainable city enhances integrated urban planning of the AMA;
2)	Sustainable mobility and transport in the AMA for reducing GHG emissions from urban transport;
3)	Improved chemicals and waste management system for reducing emissions of UPOPs, GHGs and toxic chemicals; 
4)	Emplacing and improving Protected Area management;
5)	Dissemination of Lessons-learned, monitoring & evaluation
To achieve the stated objective, the project will place Asuncion and its metropolitan area on a pathway towards a sustainable and resilient city through addressing the principal current urban problems; notably transport, solid waste disposal, and management of green areas. The project will implement a framework that attends to these issues in a systematic and integrated manner, thus providing a critical step forward to improve the city’s sustainability.
This will be done through integrating sectorial planning and defining short, medium and long term goals; developing capacities for their implementation and long term funding needs, and setting up monitoring systems needed to guide and adapt plans over time; thereby promoting a more coherent and integrated vision for the future of Asunción, in which common goals govern policy, planning and investment decisions. Furthermore, it will undertake on the ground action to address the identified problems and delivering solutions to global environment problems. This includes improving the transport and management of municipal and hazardous waste management to reduce GHG and chemicals releases; and improve the management of green areas to conserve global biodiversity values and provide ecosystem services that contribute to GHG reduction and health related benefits; exploring cross-sectorial benefits and providing important inputs and guidance to the broader framework for a sustainable and resilient city.
Expected global environmental benefits to be accrued include: a) 1,227,442 tCO2e emissions mitigated and sequestered through transport oriented development, green infrastructure and solid waste management policy uptake; b) 13.2 gTEQ UPOP emissions reduced through an integrated waste and chemical management system; and c) increase in 1% of global populations (number of individuals) of 5 species found seasonally at site:- Buff-breasted Sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis); American Golden Plover (Pluvialis dominica); Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes); White-rumped Sandpiper (Calidris fuscicollis); and Pectoral Sandpiper (Calidris melanotos).",,,Missing

This, in turn, is expected to generate direct global benefits of 137,200 tons of CO2 over the same period and 36,850 tons CO2/yr thereafter in avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, in order to ensure the availability of hydro resources for electricity generation (and irrigation for job creation), the project will implement an integrated watershed management approach. It aims at integrating natural resource management with community livelihoods improvement in a sustainable way and within a landscape approach. The project will introduce innovative participative methods of natural resource management, conservation farming and agro-ecology. This will be achieved through watershed level land use planning and implementation of community forests over 6,000 ha, sustainable agricultural land management practices over 10,000 ha, and income generating activities (such as mushrooms, medicinal plants, ecotourism, etc.) for rural communities. This landscape approach will be sustained by a financial mechanism between the private hydroelectricity producers and the upstream communities, based on the maintenance of environmental services (water supply regulation).",,,Missing

The Government of Nauru (GoN) has set three ambitious energy targets in the Nauru Energy Road Map (NERM) 2014-2020, and following updates, respectively: (1) 24/7 grid electricity supply with minimal interruptions; (2) 50% of grid electricity supplied from Renewable Energy (RE) sources; and (3) 30% improvement in Energy Efficiency (EE) in the residential, commercial and government sectors. So far, the efforts have been focused primarily on achieving the first target, which based largely on technical expertise of the national utility management team requiring very limited financial resources. Currently available technical and financial resources are insufficient to fully achieve all three targets, unless additional support from international donors is made available. SMARTEN will provide the required technical assistance and financial resources and the project design will follow a strategy based on removing all the barriers identified during the Project Information Form (PIF) preparation and successively confirmed during the SMARTEN project proposal preparation. The project is structured into four interrelating Components, respectively: (1) Energy Policy & Regulatory Framework Strengthening; (2) Supporting RE & EE Initiatives; (3) Promotion of RE & EE Technologies Applications; and (4) Improvement of Energy Sector Capacity. All the activities that make these 4 components will be implemented over a 4-year period from 2020 to 2024.

Mayaga region harbours 0.14 percent of natural forests and 10 percent of man-made plantations of Rwanda’s total forested area. The 555ha of natural forests and the many and scattered patches of indigenous forests host important biodiversity and carbon stocks and provide critical watershed services to the agricultural landscapes surrounding them.  Forest degradation has taken three pathways in Mayaga: quantitative loss; qualitative loss, and fragmentation, caused largely by encroachment for agriculture and overharvesting of forest products. Adoption of Forest Landscape Restoration as an overarching integrated landscape management strategy is hindered by: a) Inadequate mechanism for inclusive participatory development of knowledge based shared Forest Landscape Restoration objectives; b) Inadequate individual and institutional capacities for Forest Landscape Restoration; c) Inadequate implementation of sustainable land management, sustainable forest management, biodiversity conservation measures and poor uptake of diversified and efficient energy options. The project will provide a coordination mechanism for Forest Landscape Restoration planning and individual, institutional capacities to enable its implementation in four districts (Kamonyi, Ruhango, Nyanza, Gisagara). 
Executed by the Rwanda Environment Management Agency in partnership with key Ministries, the six year project total cost is US$ 32,706,365 consisting of a GEF Grant of $6,213,538, UNDP Grant of $1,000,000 and Government of Rwanda Co-fin of $25,493,365. It will have three Outcomes: a) Forest restoration plans with institutional and legislation frameworks guiding afforestation, natural resources management and agriculture; b) Individual and institutional capacities enhancement for planning and implementing gender sensitive forest landscape restoration strategies supported by knowledge management; c) Implementation of Forest Landscape Restoration plans secures 555 ha of natural forests, puts 300 ha of forests under participatory forest management, establishes 1,000 ha of plantations under the New Forest Company through co-finance, increases productivity of agriculture and plantation forests on 25,000 ha and 1,000 ha respectively; and reduces wood consumption by at least 25%. The project will deliver four Forest Landscape Restoration plans covering 263,270 ha, leading to avoided emissions of 4,700,825 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in five years and 12,950,839 tons in indirect GHG emissions avoided in 20 years.",,,Missing

The grid emission factor of Mauritius is extremely high at 1.01 tonnes CO2/MWh due to the prevalence of imported coal (39%) and fuel oil (38%) in the electricity generation mix. Net greenhouse gas emissions are increasing at a rapid rate of 3% per year. The pressing need to significantly enhance Mauritius’s energy independence and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is recognised in the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (2016), its Second National Communication to the UNFCCC (2010) and its UNFCCC Technology Needs Assessment (2014), as well as in a comprehensive suite of Government strategies and policies contained in the Long-Term Energy Strategy (2011-2025). 
Following a broad consultative process led by the NDA and backed by sound technical and financial analysis as well as cosiderable political will, this project will remove the principal bottlenecks to investment in low-carbon development for: (i) grid-connected intermittent renewable energy; and (ii) mini-grid PV for the principal outer island, Agalega. The project will be implemented in a two-phase approach so as to reduce the implementation risks to the GCF and ensure that the second funding disbursement is contingent upon successful completion of the first phase. 
The project seeks a total of USD 28.21 million of GCF grant resources, split across phase 1 (USD 12 million) and phase 2 (USD 16.21 million), to overcome identified barriers to low-carbon investment. The incremental logic of the project and its requirement for grant resources are clearly laid out in the proposal.

It has been organized into four substantive outcomes:
1.1 An updated regulatory and operational framework for sustainable public transport, fostering sustainable mobility and a more resilient urban environment.
2.1 Enhanced public transport system featuring a Public Bicycle System (PBS) and Transit Oriented Development (TOD).
2.2 Innovative pilot interventions on low-carbon investments in urban transport validated.
3.1 Programmatic monitoring of project indicators together with a review of on-going activities to ensure successful project implementation.
To achieve the stated objective, the project will place the City of La Havana on a pathway towards a sustainable and climate change resilient city by addressing perennial urban transport challenges. The project will implement a framework that responds to this issue in a systematic and integrated manner, engaging a diverse group of stakeholders including the national authorities (MINCEX and MITRANS),  primarily interested in achieving the project’s overarching development objective by accomplishing the necessary institutional and regulatory reforms and public transport quality improvements, the provincial stakeholders (DGTPH and DPPF), interested in creating the basis for an alternative urban transport system for the city, associated with the design of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system as well as reporting the environmental benefits to the GEF; technological and academic stakeholders (CUBAENERGIA, CIMAB, CUJAE, FLACSO and Project Enterprises), supporting the methodologies for MRV urban transport and integrating urban planning and design; City Transport Operators engaged in the quality of public transport provision; and CSO stakeholders (FMC, FEU and UNAICC) committed to gender mainstreaming, aging population challenges and the cultural change needed for sustainable urban mobility (TOD measures) and Non-Motorized Transport (PBS), thus providing a critical step forward to improve the city’s sustainability.

It is expected that the project will provide global environmental benefits in terms of direct emission savings of at least 69,242 tCO2eq in 4 years as well as consequential savings of at least 326,536 tCO2eq in the 10 years after the project completion.

Over the project period, the 4 pilots scheduled for implementation will generate a total of 76,651 MWh of electricity. Moving forward, these 4 pilots will have an annual generation of 24,498 MWh that would be sustained over an expected 15-year projected life of the gasifiers, resulting in the cumulative avoidance of 329,981 tCO2. When activities related to sustainable forest and land management are factored in, a total of 1,094,253 tCO2 will be avoided over the 15-year gasifier lifetime, translating into a unit abatement cost of $ 3.50 of GEF funds per tCO2 reduced.",,,Missing

The project addresses the second priority intervention identified by the 2008 NAPA of Benin: Reducing populations vulnerability to climate change impacts by providing a better access to sustainable energy sources and protecting forest resources.

The first intervention concerns the adaptation capacities of the energy sector to climate change. It will strengthen these capacities in order to enable stakeholders to integrate climate risks in energy planning and to face climate risks, so that risks of economic losses due to climate change are reduced.

The goal of the second intervention is to support the development of new frameworks for energy policies and strategies that will take climate change into consideration. Climate change issues and adaptation measures should be integrated into policies and strategies both at the national scale, and in vulnerable areas identified by the NAPA.

The third intervention will take action to reduce climate vulnerability of energy supply sources in Benin. It will focus on the resilience of watersheds, of forest areas supplying wood for energy, and of electricity production and distribution facilities. It will assess the vulnerability of these areas and take protective measures, involving all stakeholders, to protect these energy sources. Moreover, it will support the development of alternative energy production sources for vulnerable communities.",,,Missing
